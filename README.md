# ue5-vehicle-handling

Project just for code showcase.

The multiplayer code is functional but missing the client prediction system that will be posted as a separated project.

If you want to try the game download it from: [itch.io](https://lazy7.itch.io/handling)

Warning: Do not try to clone this project or it will not work. All the 3D Assets, Materials, Sounds and Plugins are missing.
